# LLM Classifier (Go)

# Introduction

This project is inspired by [lamini-ai/llm-classifier](https://github.com/lamini-ai/llm-classifier). I wanted an LLM-classifier with a similar interface and larger support for LLMs in Go.

This is a reusable Go-based LLM Classifier module designed to perform classification tasks using large language models (LLMs). The module is lightweight, highly efficient, and can be easily integrated into any Go-based application.

# Features

1. **LLM Integration:** Supports the use of various large language models.
2. **Reusable and Modular:** Can be easily plugged into any Go application with minimal configuration.
3. **Customizable:** Supports customization of classification models to do specific tasks.
4. **Scalable:** Designed to handle both small and large datasets with high throughput.
